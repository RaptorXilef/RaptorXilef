### About:
I like to learn new things and link them to small projects as a learning goal. I would also like to learn different programming languages. At the moment I only know scripting languages like HTML, CSS, CMD & PowerShell. But hopefully I will learn more in the future.
I am always open for constructive feedback. So keep it coming!
